SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
-------------------

Shotrecorder has been tested on the following platforms:

 * Nokia N900 (Maemo 5)
 * Ubuntu 11.10 amd64

That said, it should work on pretty much any platform supporting Python and 
PySide (e.g. Windows, OSX, FreeBSD, Android). If PySide is not available for 
your platform, porting it to PyQt should be a matter of changing a few import 
statements.


DEPENDENCIES
------------

To use Shotrecorder you need the following:

 * Python (2.5+)
 * PySide (Qt bindings for Python)
 * PySide QtGui (QtGui module binds for Python)
 * Git (if you want to use development versions)


INSTALLATION ON UBUNTU/DEBIAN
-----------------------------

First you need install the dependencies:

 $ apt-get update
 $ apt-get install python-pyside.qtgui

Next extract shotrecorder to a directory:

 $ cd <shotrecorder-download-directory>
 $ tar -zxf shotrecorder-<version>.tar.gz


INSTALLATION ON NOKIA N900
--------------------------

PySide is not available in the default Maemo/Nokia repositories. Fortunately 
it's fairly easy to add the "extras-devel" repository that has it:

<http://wiki.maemo.org/Extras-devel#How_to_activate_Extras-devel>

Once the repository has been activated, you can follow the generic Ubuntu/Debian 
instructions (above).


INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS
-----------------------

NOTE: This installation procedure is probably correct, but has not been tested.

First, install Windows versions of Python and PySide:

<http://www.python.org/getit/windows>
<http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/PySide_Binaries_Windows>

Next extract the shotrecorder-<version>.tar.gz with WinRAR (or your application 
of choice):

<http://www.rarlab.com>


RUNNING
-------

Running shotrecorder is easy, you just load the included "srmain.py" with the 
Python interpreter. If you're using the command-line, use something like this:

 $ cd shotrecorder-<version>
 $ python srmain.py

Alternatively you can launch "srmain.py" from a graphical file manager (e.g. 
Windows Explorer, Nautilus or Finder.
