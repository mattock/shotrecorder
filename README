INTRODUCTION

This application is intended for collecting chronograph measurements and saving 
them into to a file for further processing. This is all it does at the moment, 
although there are plans for extending it's functionality.

The TODO file contains known issues and future plans. The INSTALL file contains 
installation instructions for various platforms.


USAGE

Showrecorder should be fairly easy to use. At the moment there are only four 
main user interface components, the session menu, shot list, data entry prompt 
and two buttons to add or delete shots.

The session menu is used to load, save or create a new session. A session is a 
series of shots where no variables have changed(*), so the measurements should 
be fairly consistent. If any variable has changed, you should save the current 
session and create a new one.

(*) The variables include things like draw length, bolt weight or bowstring 
    weight on a crossbow. For guns it can include things like the amount of 
    or the type of gunpowder used in a cartridge, or the bullet type.
